# Aim to put my machine learning knowledge into practice
Description
- My main goal was to predict obesity levels based on given features (eating habits and physical condition).
- ML models I used include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, KNN

Dataset
- The dataset I used was "Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition" which I downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository
